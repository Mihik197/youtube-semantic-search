I have a codebase that was generated through iterative AI prompting and error fixing. While functional, it's messy and hard to understand. Please refactor it with a focus on simplification and clarity, not enterprise complexity.
Core Objective:
Make the code simpler, shorter, and easier to understand while keeping ALL existing functionality intact. The refactored code should have fewer lines overall.
Refactoring Guidelines:

Simplify Structure:

Combine related functions that are only used once
Merge files if they're tightly coupled and small
Only create separate modules when there's clear reuse or logical separation
Flatten unnecessary nested structures
Remove abstraction layers that don't add value


Reduce Code Volume:

Eliminate duplicate code by extracting common patterns
Replace verbose constructs with concise equivalents
Use built-in functions/methods instead of reinventing them
Remove unnecessary intermediate variables
Combine operations where it doesn't hurt readability


Clean Up Defensive Programming:

Remove try-catch blocks except where errors actually occur
Delete redundant validation checks
Remove unnecessary null/undefined checks
Eliminate belt-and-suspenders coding patterns


Make It Readable:

Use clear, descriptive names (this is more important than comments)
Remove obvious comments, keep only crucial explanations
Simplify complex conditionals into readable expressions
Extract magic numbers/strings into named constants only if used multiple times


Practical Organization:

Group related functionality together
Put truly reusable utilities in a common file
Keep the file structure flat and obvious
Don't create classes unless they genuinely simplify the code
Prefer functions over classes when state management isn't needed



What NOT to do:

Don't add design patterns for the sake of it
Don't create interfaces/abstractions for single implementations
Don't split code into many tiny files
Don't add "enterprise" features (dependency injection, factory patterns, etc.)
Don't add extensive error handling "just in case"
Don't over-modularize

Approach:

When unsure about something, look up the documentation or common practices
Prefer the simpler solution when two approaches work equally well
If something works and is already simple, leave it alone
Think "what would make this code obvious to someone reading it for the first time"

Expected Outcome:
The refactored code should be:

Shorter (fewer total lines)
Easier to navigate (fewer files to jump between)
More obvious (can understand what it does by reading it)
Still fully functional (everything still works)

Focus on pragmatic improvements that actually make the code easier to work with, not theoretical best practices. Think clarity and simplicity over sophistication.Retry
